          Sample script: "I would like to speak with you regarding how the caseworker has worked with you and your child.
          We want to make sure that we give the best service possible to children, so we are asking how the caseworker helped your child and if there is anything we could do differently / better.
          You do not have to tell us anything if you don’t want to and you don’t have to tell me your reasons for that.
          Even if you decide not to tell us anything, this will not affect the support that your child gets from us.
          However, sharing your thoughts and feelings with us may help us improve what we do for other children and families.
          Anything you tell us will be kept private. This means that although we will share what you say, we won’t tell anyone that you are the one who told us.
          You can also decide to only not answer certain questions, or change your mind and decide not to continue whenever you wish."
