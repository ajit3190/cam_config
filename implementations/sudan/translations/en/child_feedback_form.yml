          Sample script: "I would like to speak with you regarding how the caseworker has worked with you and your family.
          We want to make sure that we give the best service possible to children, so we are asking how the caseworker helped you and if there is anything we could do differently / better. You do not have to tell us anything if you don’t want to and you don’t have to tell me your reasons for that.
          Even if you decide not to tell us anything, this will not affect the support that you and your family get from us.
          However, sharing your thoughts and feelings with us may help us improve what we do for other children and families.
          Anything you tell us will be kept private. This means that although we will share what you say, we won’t tell anyone that you are the one who told us.
          You can also decide to only not answer certain questions, or change your mind and decide not to continue whenever you wish."

          You can give examples to prompt feedback, but be careful about asking leading questions.
          This format is suitable for older children (10 years or older) – it can be adapted for younger children as required.
          It should be conducted in the language of the child, and facilitated by someone who has the necessary skills and training to facilitate feedback with children, and understands the ethics of working directly with children.
